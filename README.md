# Computer-Vision-Project-Globe-Detection
Political globe detection in a cluttered environment

The common problem in computer vision is to search and find specific objects or shapes in a picture or video stream. In this particular project we were asked to design and implement a complete procedure that can identify the small political globe, in any orientation and a cluttered environment, either by selecting available tools or by writing our own code.
